This repository contains boilerplate code for a RESTful API based on Flask and Flask-RESTPlus in Python.

The code of this demo app is described in an article on my blog:
http://michal.karzynski.pl/blog/2016/06/19/building-beautiful-restful-apis-using-flask-swagger-ui-flask-restplus/

It makes use of:
* Python 3
* Flask
* Swagger UI (via `restplus`)
* Simple SQL model (thanks to `SQLAlchemy`)
* Alpine Linux (if running as a docker container)
